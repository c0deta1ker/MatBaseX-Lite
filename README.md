# MatBaseX: Comprehensive Materials and X-ray Interaction Database for Photoelectron Spectroscopy Analysis  

[MatBaseX](https://github.com/c0deta1ker/MatBaseX) is a comprehensive database and analytical tool tailored for photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) analysis, emphasizing the study of materials and their X-ray interactions. It seamlessly integrates calculators and databases into one platform, providing functionalities such as a Materials Properties Database for managing data, tools for analysing X-ray Photoionization Energies, Cross-Sections, and X-ray Absorption and Scattering Factors. These features help users very quickly identify which core-levels give the most intensity at a given photon energy (via cross-section maximisation) or locate absorption edges for resonance spectroscopy. It also includes calculators for electron inelastic mean free path (IMFP) determination using eight different formalisms, as well as an XPS Sensitivity Factor Calculator to support precise, quantitative PES analysis.     

Additional features include PES N-Layer Simulations, which utilizes the Beer-Lambert law to compute intensities for a user-defined heterostructure, and a PES Curve Fitting App that allows users to quickly load in experimental data (two-column text file containing binding energy and intensity values) and determine the best fit. By integrating all these advanced databases, calculators, and analytical tools, MatBaseX helps researchers streamline workflows and enhance the precision of their data analysis.

![MatBaseX_02_CrystallographyViewer](MatBaseX-v1.3/ReadMeImages/MatBaseX_02_CrystallographyViewer.png)    

**(4) X-Ray Photoionization Binding Energy & Cross-Section Database**: Comprehensive element data is available for elements 1-98, derived from four distinct formalisms: Scofield (1973), Yeh & Lindau (1985), Trzhaskovskaya (2018), and Cant (2022). The app allows for the plotting of binding energy spectra, photoionization cross-sections, and photoionization asymmetry parameters. Users can easily identify the optimal core levels for probing by locating maximum cross-sections at specific photon energies. Additionally, binding energies and photoionization parameters can be conveniently saved or exported as text files.    
![MatBaseX_03_XrayPhotoionization](MatBaseX-v1.3/ReadMeImages/MatBaseX_03_XrayPhotoionization.png)     

**(5) X-Ray Absorption Edge & Scattering Factor Database**: Elements 1-92 is available, including all material entries composed of these elements. The app allows users to plot and calculate absorption edge spectra (from IXAS) and scattering factors (from Henke and NIST). Additionally, it supports calculations for photoelectric mass attenuation coefficients, refractive indices, critical angles, transmission, and reflectance. Absorption edges for resonance spectroscopy can be easily identified, and users have the option to save or export absorption edges or scattering factors as text files.      
![MatBaseX_04_XrayAbsorption](MatBaseX-v1.3/ReadMeImages/MatBaseX_04_XrayAbsorption.png)     

**(6) Electron Inelastic Mean Free Path Calculator**: Users have access to all material entries, and can also manually input data for materials not included in the database. The platform enables plotting and calculation of the Inelastic Mean Free Path (IMFP) using various formalisms, such as Universal, TPP-2M, Optical Data (NIST), S1, S2, S3, S4, and JTP methods. Additionally, it estimates standard deviation across these methods for uncertainty quantification. IMFP data can be plotted, exported, or saved for future reference.

**(7) XPS Sensitivity Factor Calculator**: The app seamlessly integrates databases for IMFP, photoionization cross-sections, and asymmetry parameters. Users can customize experimental geometry, photon polarization, and select preferred formalisms for IMFP and cross-section calculations. Core levels can be easily chosen to generate sensitivity factor plots against photon energy and emission angle with just one click, making it invaluable for precise and quantitative XPS analysis. All data can be saved and / or exported as text files for convenience. Indispensable for precise, quantitative XPS analysis.       
![MatBaseX_06_XPSSensitivityFactor](MatBaseX-v1.3/ReadMeImages/MatBaseX_06_XPSSensitivityFactor.png)  

**(8) PES - N-Layer Simulations**: The app provides access to all material entries, enabling users to design an N-layer heterostructure sample stack with uniform concentration and thickness. It also integrates the databases for IMFP, photoionization cross-sections, and asymmetry parameters. PES intensities can be precisely calculated using the Beer-Lambert law, adjusted for electron IMFP in alignment with experimental configurations. Users can visually represent variations in photon energy and emission angles. Models can be saved for future use, easily reloaded into the application, and exported as .txt files for external use.    
![MatBaseX_07_PES_NLayerSimulations](MatBaseX-v1.3/ReadMeImages/MatBaseX_07_PES_NLayerSimulations.png)         

**(9) PES - Curve Fitting**: Accurately peak fit your XPS/PES data. Construct initial models with various curve shapes (Gaussian, Lorentzian, Voigt, or Doniach-Sunjic). Manually define the binding energy, spin-orbit split components and branching ratios or type in the core-level of interest, and if it exists in the binding energy database, all these parameters will be loaded automatically. Subtract the background using Polynomial, Shirley, or Tougaard methods, and enter lower/upper bound estimates for fit parameters. Run optimization algorithms to achieve the best fit. Fits can be exported or saved, and reloaded into the application for future use. Simple and efficient to use for fast peak fitting and chemical shift identification.
