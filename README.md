# MatBaseX-Lite: Comprehensive Materials and X-ray Interaction Database for Photoelectron Spectroscopy Analysis  

A streamlined version of the [MatBaseX](https://github.com/c0deta1ker/MatBaseX) MATLAB-based suite. This edition offers the full functionality of the original, with all Apps and functions accessible directly within the MATLAB environment. However, all tutorials, examples, and figures have been removed from this repository, reducing the download size to approximately 200 MB compared to the original 30 GB. This version is ideal for users who only require the core features and code for all functions and Apps, without additional documentation or sample data. For full information of its capabilities, please see [MatBaseX](https://github.com/c0deta1ker/MatBaseX).
